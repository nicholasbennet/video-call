# Video Call with Audio and Video filters

This project aims to create a peer to peer video calling application with support for multiple audio and video filters.

## Usage

Please edit the variable `HOST` to reflect IPV4 address of the server.

If you are hosting the server on AWS `HOST` on `server.py` will be the VMs private IP and `HOST` on `client.py` will be the public IP of the VM
